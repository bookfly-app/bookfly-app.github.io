		writers. It's a space where us bookworms can make posts discussing, rating, 
		reviewing, and updating our followers on books.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">The Wallflower team, the legal owner of wallflower.land, is a non-profit organization originally created by <!> as a passion project in college. The name <i>Wallflower</i> comes from <!>'s favorite book <!> by Stephen Chbosky.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">Powered by volunteers, no one on the Wallflower team makes a cent off of the project. 
		wallflower.land is completely ad-free with zero in-app purchases.</p> <h2 class="svelte-672642">Team &amp; Values</h2> <p class="svelte-672642">Wallflower is still led by its original creator, <!>, 
		a nonbinary reader, writer, and college student. Wallflower will always support kindness, acceptance, diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">Currently, Wallflower has no other team members.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">Wallflower does not support the use of AI, and will not be integrating AI features into the website or app.</p> <h2 class="svelte-672642">Moderation</h2> <p class="svelte-672642">The Wallflower team moderates content posted to Wallflower. Harmful and hateful content will be removed. Wallflower also may remove content that's
		off-topic&mdash;Posting repeatedly with no relation to books or writing may get your account flagged. wallflower.land was designed to be a safe and cozy
		space for people to talk about and discover books. Nothing more, nothing less.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">Wallflower will never remove relevant constructive content based on opinion. Users are free to share as much dislike and distaste for books,
		writing styles, and author's specific works or styles. Do not attack authors themselves. Criticize the works, not the people.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">These moderation rules are loosely defined. Each situation will be handled by a case-by-case basis and judged by Wallflower's moderators, who are
		trusted to make educated judgements.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">If your account was suspended or banned and you feel it was wrongful, you can submit an appeal. Your content will be reviewed and a secondary,
		more thorough judgement will be passed to you.</p> <h2 class="svelte-672642">Legal</h2> <p class="svelte-672642">Wallflower is open source, meaning anyone can view and contribute to its code
		(<!>, if you're curious).</p> <p class="svelte-672642">Wallflower is licensed as <i>all rights reserved</i>, 
		meaning you are legally not allowed to use, copy, or distribute its code without explicit authorization from its creator, <!>.</p> <p class="svelte-672642">You are free to contact <!> to ask for permission to use Wallflower's code for some specific circumstance.
