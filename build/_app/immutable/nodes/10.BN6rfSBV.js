		writers. It's a space where us bookworms can make posts discussing, rating, 
		reviewing, and updating our followers on books.</p> <p class="svelte-mgziy7">Wallflower Land LLC&trade;, the legal owner of wallflower.land, is a non-profit organization originally created by <a href="/profile/vi" class="svelte-mgziy7">@vi</a> as a passion project in college. The name <i>Wallflower</i> comes from <a href="/profile/vi" class="svelte-mgziy7">@vi</a>'s favorite book <a href="/book/9780671027346" class="svelte-mgziy7"><i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i></a> by Stephen Chbosky.</p> <p class="svelte-mgziy7">Powered by volunteers, no one at Wallflower LLC makes a cent off of the project. 
		wallflower.land is completely ad-free with zero in-app purchases.</p> <h2 class="svelte-mgziy7">Team &amp; Values</h2> <p class="svelte-mgziy7">Wallflower is still led by its original creator, <a href="/profile/vi" class="svelte-mgziy7">@vi</a>,

Harmful and hateful content will be removed. Wallflower also may remove content that's
		off-topic&mdash;Posting repeatedly with no relation to books or writing may get your account flagged. wallflower.land was designed to be a safe and cozy
		space for people to talk about and discover books. Nothing more, nothing less.</p> <p class="svelte-mgziy7">Wallflower will never remove relevant constructive content based on opinion. Users are free to share as much dislike and distaste for books,
		writing styles, and author's specific works or styles. Do not attack authors themselves. Criticize the works, not the people.</p> <p class="svelte-mgziy7">These moderation rules are loosely defined. Each situation will be handled by a case-by-case basis and judged by Wallflower's moderators, who are
		trusted to make educated judgements.</p> <p class="svelte-mgziy7">If your account was suspended or banned and you feel it was wrongful, you can submit an appeal. Your content will be reviewed and a secondary,
		more thorough judgement will be passed to you.</p> <h2 class="svelte-mgziy7">Legal</h2> <p class="svelte-mgziy7">Wallflower is open source, meaning anyone can view and contribute to its code
