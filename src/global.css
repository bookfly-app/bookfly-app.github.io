 * dear lord, this is hilarious to me.
 *
 * on firefox, when you autofill a form value, it sets the background
 * to this horrendous yellow. 
 *
 * come to find out, you cant just override that background color; firefox
 * just doesnt let you.
 *
 * so i do some digging n stumble across THIS ANSWER:
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/79433914 
 *
 * which makes this css rule that says "i know we cant stop you from
 * changing the background, but we can change the *time* it takes to
 * change the background, so im just going to set that to infinity."
 *
 * so, yeah, it *is* trying to change the background, just that... it
 * takes an infinite amount of time. god, what a stupid problem and a
 * stupid workaround.
 *
 * one must imagine firefox sisyphus happy
